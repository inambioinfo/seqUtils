\title{Filter peak calls based on how many other samples they are found in.}
\usage{
filterOverlaps(peak_list, minOverlapCount = 3)

\item{peak_list}{list of GRanges objects corresponding to peak calls.}

\item{minOverlapCount}{Minimal number of samples the peak has to be present to be retained.}
}
\value{
List of GRanges objects corresponding to filtered peak calls from each sample, only peaks 
that were present in minOverlapCount samples are retained.
}
\description{
For each set of peak calls, find the ones that are present in at least minOverlapCount samples.
